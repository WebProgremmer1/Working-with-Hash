By woking with Hash we can determine not only if the information are identical to the original information. Also, we can determine if it consists some marware elements. 
As the same malware file will have the same hash address. 

The main idea for this program is compare provided or generated hashs with database of malware hashs. So we are going to check if file can consist some matware files. 
To get data I use this website https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/ . I can access more than 1022741 hashs that consider to be programs with malware. 
But for now, I will retrict the number of hushs to 10541. To the most recent ones, maybe in the future I will implement with full number of hashs.
